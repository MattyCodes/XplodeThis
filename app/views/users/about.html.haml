        Built For Agents and Brokers
        %span.glyphicon.glyphicon-off.about-icon
      %p We believe that agents and brokers deserve intelligent conferences, loaded with great speakers and useful ideas. That’s why our conference forgoes sales pitches in favor of genuinely useful sessions on digital marketing, social media, predictive data and video. If you’re trying to figure out what’s next, Xplode is the conference for you.

        Intelligently Paced
        %span.glyphicon.glyphicon-repeat.about-icon
      %p Ever been to a conference with sessions that are just too long and boring? That will never happen at Xplode. Our speakers present in 20-40 minute increments, just enough to present their topics in-depth, without droning on about what doesn’t matter to you. If you want serious content in a compressed, works-for-you format, Xplode is it.
      %h4
        Meaningful Content
        %span.glyphicon.glyphicon-star-empty.about-icon
      %p Xplode was founded in 2011 by Mat Fagioli, a broker from Atlanta, who wanted to stage a conference he would want to attend. If you know Matt, he’s the type of guy who is all-business, as well as short, sweet and to the point — just like the presentations you’ll see at Xplode. But he’s also dedicated to God and family, so you can count on Xplode’s speakers to present meaningful content that will make a difference in your business. Matt wouldn’t have it any other way.
      %h4
        Friendly Environment
        %span.glyphicon.glyphicon-heart-empty.about-icon
      %p Matt believes that Xplode is for every type of agent — whether you’re a new agent just learning the ropes, or have been in the business for 20 years, you’ll learn something new at Xplode. Matt’s mission is to enrich the lives of Xplode’s attendees (who he treats as family). That’s why the environment at an Xplode conference is welcoming and dynamic. You’ll meet all kinds of people at Xplode, who will take you to the next level in your business.
